# Stock Market Prediction Project

Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction project repository. This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Stock Market Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisandresgarcia/stock-market-prediction).

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective:** Understand the structure and characteristics of the stock market dataset.
- **Activities:**
  - Load and clean the dataset.
  - Analyze basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of stock prices.
  - Visualize key trends and patterns in stock prices over time using line plots, histograms, and box plots.
  - Identify and handle missing values or outliers if present.

### 2. Predictive Modeling
- **Objective:** Forecast future stock values using machine learning regression models.
- **Activities:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Implement various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
  - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
  - Fine-tune models to improve prediction accuracy.

### 3. Documentation
- **Objective:** Provide a comprehensive guide on the methodologies and insights gained from the dataset.
- **Activities:**
  - Document the approach taken for EDA and predictive modeling.
  - Explain the rationale behind the selection of specific models.
  - Summarize the findings and insights obtained from the analysis.
  - Include code snippets, plots, and graphs to support the explanations.
    
### Results and Insights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Detailed insights into the data distribution, key statistics, and visualization of stock price trends.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of various regression models with their performance metrics. Insights on model selection and tuning for optimal results.
  
### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis and the implementation of various regression models, we gained valuable insights into stock price trends and predictive performance. The models developed provide a foundational approach for more advanced predictive analytics in the stock market domain. Future work could involve incorporating more sophisticated models and additional market factors to enhance prediction accuracy.
